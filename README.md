The Jupyter Notebook "Fast_DGEC_vs_PnP_Demo_Notebook.ipynb" contains demo of the multicoil fastMRI image reconstruction using the D-GEC algorithm. This demo compares the performance of D-GEC and PnP-PDS. 

Please download the data and the pre-trained denoisers required for the demo here: https://buckeyemailosu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/shastri_19_buckeyemail_osu_edu/EpXV2uwXrJxArgnizYz7OMMBHw3YxOYugjG3JWj6jnmYCw?e=xVazha

To make sure that the versions of the packages match those we tested the code with, we recommend creating a new virtual environment and installing packages using `conda` with the following command.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
